    <h1>Philip Emeagwali</h1>
    <div><b> Emeagwali is a Nigerian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist" target="blank">computer
                scientist</a>.
            He has been living in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" target="blank"> United
                States</a>
            for many years. [1] He won the 1989 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Bell_Prize"
                target="blank">Gordon Bell Prize</a> ($1,000) for price-performance in
            high-performance computing applications, in an oil reservoir modeling calculation using a novel
            mathematical formulation and implementation.[2][3]</b></div>
    <h2 id="Biography">Biography</h2>
    <div>Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.[4] His early schooling was suspended in 1967 as a
        result of the Nigerian Civil War. At 13 years, he served in the Biafran army. After the war he completed
        high-school equivalence through self-study.
        He is married to Dale Brown Emeagwali, a noted African-American microbiologist.[5]</div>
    <h2 id="Education">Education</h2>
    <div><i>He traveled to the United States to study under a scholarship following completion of a correspondence
            course at the University of London. He received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Oregon State
            University in 1977. He later moved to Washington DC, receiving in 1986 a master's degree from George
            Washington University in ocean and marine engineering, and a second master's in applied mathematics from the
            University of Maryland. Next magazine suggested that Emeagwali claimed to have further degrees.[6][7] During
            this time, he worked as a civil engineer at the Bureau of Land Reclamation in Wyoming.</i></div>
    <h3 id="Court case and the denial of degree">Court case and the denial of degree</h3>
    <div>Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991. His thesis was not
        accepted by a committee of internal and external examiners and thus he was not awarded the degree. Emeagwali
        filed a court challenge, stating that the decision was a violation of his civil rights and that the university
        had discriminated against him in several ways because of his race. The court challenge was dismissed, as was an
        appeal to the Michigan state Court of Appeals.[8]</div>
    <h2 id="Supercomputing">Supercomputing</h2>
    <div><i>Emeagwali received the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for an application of the CM-2 massively-parallel computer.
            The application used computational fluid dynamics for oil-reservoir modeling. He received a prize in
            "price/performance" category, with a performance figure of about 400 Mflops/$1M.[15] The winner in the
            "performance" category, was also the winner of the Price/performance category, but unable to receive two
            prizes. Mobil Research and Thinking Machines, used the CM-2 for seismic data processing and achieved the
            higher ratio of 500 Mflops/$1M. The judges decided on one award per entry.[3][2] His method involved each
            microprocessor communicating with six neighbors.[10]</i>
        <br>
        <br>Emeagwali's simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time approach to reservoir modeling.[1]
